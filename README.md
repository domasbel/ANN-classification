# Repository for NN mini projects 

1. Simple NN - in this project I have developed a regression model to predict customer income using 12 features, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, neural network design, and hyperparameter tuning. Categorical variables are encoded using label and one-hot encoding, while continuous variables are normalized for better model performance. A neural network is implemented in both TensorFlow and Keras, with hyperparameters optimized through Grid Search and K-Fold Cross-Validation to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE). Key tools include TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and GridSearchCV, demonstrating expertise in building robust and efficient predictive models.

2. RNN - next project involves training an RNN-based neural network for sentiment classification using the IMDB reviews dataset. The model's performance was enhanced through manual hyperparameter tuning, including adjustments to L2 regularization, dropout layers, epoch number and batch size. The solution was further deployed with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling real-time sentiment classification with the trained model. This project highlights expertise in RNN design, hyperparameter optimization, and deployment of machine learning solutions.
